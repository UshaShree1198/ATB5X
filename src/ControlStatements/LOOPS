  Looping statements in java is continuous execution until the evaluation of the expression turns out to be false.
  loops means to perform a tast multiple times
 3 TYPES 1. FOR LOOP
         2. WHILE
         3. DO WHILE

         *****break and continue works in loops

       *FOR LOOP : For loop is generally used when the user knows the exact number of iterations.
                   based on condition task will perform multiple times
                   for loop is a control flow statement that iterates a part of the programs multiple times.
                   for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
                   {
                   System.out.println(i);
                   }

        * WHILE  : While loop uses when the user is not aware of the exact iteration number.
                    while loop is a control flow statement that executes a part of the programs repeatedly on the basis
                    of given boolean condition.
                  int i=1;
                  while(i<=10){
                  System.out.println(i);
                  i++;
                  }



       * DO whILE : This statement first executes the statement under "do" after that it checks the condition of "while".
                     This statement executes at least once even though the statement generates a "false" value.
                     Do while loop is basically an "exit control loop".
                     There is only one type of “Do while loop” which is called "Infinite Do While Loop".

                      int i=1;
                      do{
                      System.out.println(i);
                      i++;
                      }while(i<=10);
