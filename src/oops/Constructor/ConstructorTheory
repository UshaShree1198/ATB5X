  Constructor is special method that initialize objects.
  It is called when instance of class is created (i.e)  new object()
  Java compiler creates default constructor. if you doesnt have any. invoked implicitly
  Constructor name should be same as class name
  2 types of constructor 1. default 2. parameterized constructor
  default constructor is used to provide default values to object like null,0 depending on the type
  The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.
  Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists.
  Constructor does not have return type.
