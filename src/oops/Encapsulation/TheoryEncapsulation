Encapsulation describes the ability of an object to hide its data and methods from rest of the world.
real time example is class.. class is a container which has variables and methods.
Encapsulation is used to secure our data. so that we should not expose our data  , by not giving access to data outside the object ,
we are giving access to data only through methods.
benefit of encapsulation in Java is that it minimises the risk of external inheritance of the codes and data that you use.
 This benefit can preserve the security and privacy of sensitive information that relates to a company's customers and employees.
The getter method in Java is useful for collecting a variable's value
The setter method is a process that programmers use to update a variable's values.

// HOW TO ACHIEVE ENCAPSULATION
The first task is to define the variable of the class as private, as this act can confirm the security that encapsulation provides.
The second task you can complete to achieve encapsulation is to provide setter and getter methods that are public.
